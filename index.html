          <h2>Prime Minister of the UK... Twice</h2>
          <p>
            Churchill was politically active for most of his adult life. He
            eventually achieved the highest elected position in the British
            government - Prime Minister. From this seat, he used his power to
            rearm the British and fight against the Nazis.

          <h2>Won the War Against the Axis Powers</h2>
          <p>
            Churchill rallied the British people and returned from the brink of
            defeat to defeat the German war machine.

          <h2>Warned Against the Impending Rise of the Soviet Empire</h2>
          <p>
            The "Iron Curtain" speech showed that Churchill was cognizant of the
            rising threat of the Eastern Block, and he attempted to warn
            everyone who would listen.

          <h2>
            He Was Elected to the Highest Elected Position of the UK Government
          </h2>
          <p>
            Churchill was not universally liked, but his ability to orate and
            garner feelings in the general public allowed him to rise to the
            highest elected position in the British Government.
          </p>
          <p>
            He first served as Prime Minister from May 1940 until June 1945, and
            then again from October 1951 until April 1955.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the end of his second term, he was all but forced out of office
            due to his declining health and his overbearing personality.
            However, despite this, he cemented the relationship between the
            United States and the UK, and ushered in an era of peace.
          </p>
          <h2>Kept Morale High against the German War Machine</h2>
          <p>
            Britain was on the brink of defeat against Germany, but Churchill
            was able to continually rally his government and subjects to support
            the war efforts and follow his plans.

          <p>
            The Lend Lease Agreement allowed Britain to rearm with American-made
            weapons and put up a fight against the Nazis in the early war.

          <h2>Helped Shape the Allies' War Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            Churchill contributed to overall military posture of the Allies, and
            although all of his ideas did not come to fruition, he was able to
            steer the Allies into a unified front to confront the Axis powers.

            As the war subsided and the Allied coalition began to fall apart,
            Churchill warned the West of the Soviet Union's goals to take over
            Eastern Europe.

          <p>
            He gave the famous "Iron Curtain" speech, which became a household

            Cold War began progressing.
